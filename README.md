QtSpotify - Experimental
=========
**Please note that this is experimental code with __advanced__ concepts**.

Qt 5 wrapper for libspotify.
The goal is to fully implement all functionality that libspotify provides.

Full QML usability is also implemented.


### Prerequisities
* Preferably Qt 5.2 (http://qt-project.org/downloads) altough other versions will probably also work.
* C++11 compiler. C++11 is not used extensively, but might be preferable due to Qt implementation.
* Libspotify (https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#download)


### Platform independency
Since Qt is platform independent, and libspotify is available for many different platforms and
architectures, it should theoretically be possible to compile this on any machine that
libspotify supports (Windows (Phone), Linux, iOS, Android, ARM (v5, v6, v7), Mac OS X)
* Windows
* Windows Phone
* Linux
* iOS
* Android
* ARM (v5, v6, v7)
* Mac OS X


##### Current build tests
* Qt 5.2.1 MSVC 2012
* Qt 5.2.0 MSVC 2012
